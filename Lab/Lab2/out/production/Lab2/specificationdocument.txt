Objects needed to build:
Walls- that prevent pacman and ghosts from escaping the play
area.
A game boundary, for the 200x500 pixel ground, so "dots" and food can
not spawn outside of the boundary.
NOTE: some pacman levels allow pac man and ghosts to go through one side of the boundary
to the mirrored side.
Fruits needed to give a speed buff for pac man.
Big Dots so pac man can eat ghosts.

Edge testing could be testing the gameobjects with one another for collision
pacman colliding with ghost = pacman is not alive, game over
pacman/ghosts w/ walls = can not move there
pacman colliding with scared ghosts = ghost dies then respawns
